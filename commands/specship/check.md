# SpecShip Check: `$ARGUMENTS`

The **gate & health door** — verify intent against code and keep the spec↔code
links honest. Route on the first token of `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Dispatch

- **(no argument)** → run the enforcement gate:
  ```bash
  specship check
  ```
  Composes spec↔code drift, architecture fitness, maintainability, and the
  spec→test→verify behaviour chain. Strictly opt-in gating — with no `enforce`
  config it only advises and exits 0. Summarize the gated failures, if any.
- **`drifted`** → the review queue: call `mcp__specship__specship_drifted`
  (optional `state` filter) for links that are drifted (spec or code changed),
  broken (verification failed), or orphaned (target symbol gone).
- **`fix <SPEC_ID>`** → repair a drifted/broken link via the bundled workflow:
  ```bash
  specship workflow run spec-fix --input SPEC_ID=<ID>
  ```
  Diagnoses (spec hash vs code signature vs failing test) → approve → apply →
  `specship_link_verify` back to `verified`.
- **`relink <SPEC_ID>`** → for an **orphaned** link (the target symbol no longer
  exists): re-point it at the symbol's new location/name, then re-assert.
- **`health`** → graph-derived code health:
  ```bash
  specship maintainability
  ```
  Shows the high-precision findings (oversized symbols, god files, dependency
  cycles), ranked and capped. Add `--deep` for the lower-confidence dead-code and
  coupling findings; `--json` for the full tagged set (CI).

## After running tests against a spec link

Report the outcome with `mcp__specship__specship_link_verify`
(`result: "pass" | "fail"`) so the link moves to `verified` (or `broken`).
